Project brief (final prompt for implementation)
Create a clean, professional Tailwind front end for an existing Flask phone-directory backend. Keep the Python server unchanged and deliver a single, polished templates/index.html that looks hand-crafted and natural — not AI‑generated. The page should be simple, attractive, and easy to use.

Hard constraints
Do not modify any Python code. The frontend must work with these endpoints exactly:

GET /api/phones — returns JSON list of phones

POST /api/phones/save — accepts JSON payload to add/update a phone

DELETE /api/phones/<id> — deletes a phone by id

Single HTML file only: all JavaScript must be inline inside a <script> tag in the HTML; do not add separate .js files.

No animations or moving backgrounds. Avoid anything flashy or automated.

No pie charts or complex visualizations. Use subtle summary cards, badges, emojis and color accents instead.

No changes to backend behavior or routes.

UI and UX requirements
Framework: Tailwind CSS (CDN is acceptable for development).

Theme: Dark but not pitch black — use slate tones for a softer dark theme.

Layout: Single-page layout with the phone list visible in the main UI (table or card list). The list is the primary focus.

Summary cards: Top row with three cards: Total Phones, Unique Brands, Average Market Price.

Badges & emojis: Brand badges should use a small, consistent color palette and a small emoji mapping for common brands (Apple → 🍎, Samsung → 📱, etc.).

Search: A prominent search bar that filters client-side by brand, model, price, or ID.

Form: Inline add/edit form (hidden by default) that includes fields: phoneid (hidden), brand, model, price. Prefill form when editing.

Delete confirmation: Replace window.confirm() with an in-site modal (Tailwind-styled) that shows brand/model/price and has Cancel/Delete buttons.

ID generation: For new entries, generate a unique phoneid client-side (e.g., max(existing ids)+1 or timestamp) before sending to /api/phones/save.

Accessibility: Modal should focus a button when opened; buttons must be keyboard accessible.

Footer & contact
Footer must read naturally and include:

Title: This project made by

Names (no trailing periods) in a distinct font: Bisma Sulhary and Kamran Hussain

Contact & links:

Gmail compose link for Bisma (open in new tab):
https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&to=bismahsulhary@gmail.com

Kamran email as mailto: or Gmail compose (your choice)

GitHub repo: https://github.com/sharkamran111/ITC-PROJECT.git

Short helper text: “Need help or want to contribute? Reach out via email or open an issue on the repo.”

Make the footer readable, well spaced, and visually consistent with the rest of the UI.

Behavior & integration details
Data flow: Frontend must call the existing JSON endpoints exactly as implemented. For save use POST /api/phones/save with JSON body matching backend expectations (include phoneid, brand, model, price).

Editing: Clicking Edit opens the inline form and pre-fills fields. Submitting sends JSON to /api/phones/save.

Deleting: Clicking Delete opens the in‑site modal; confirming sends DELETE /api/phones/<id> and refreshes the list.

Search & filtering: Client-side filtering only (no new backend routes).

UI updates: After save/delete the UI should update without requiring a full page reload.

Deliverable
Primary deliverable: templates/index.html — complete Tailwind HTML with inline <script> implementing:

Fetching /api/phones and rendering the list

Client-side search and filtering

Inline add/edit form and submission to /api/phones/save

In-site delete confirmation modal and DELETE call

Summary cards and badge rendering

Footer with provided contact links (Gmail compose link for Bisma)

Include minimal comments at the top of the file explaining:

Where to change the footer emails and repo link

Which lines call the backend endpoints

How to adjust price color thresholds or palette

Provide a short testing checklist (3–5 lines) at the top of the file describing how to test: start Flask, open http://localhost:5500/, add/edit/delete entries, and verify footer links.

Acceptance criteria
Start Flask app unchanged and open http://localhost:5500/.

Page loads and shows summary cards and the phone list (fetched from /api/phones).

Search filters the list instantly by brand, model, price, or ID.

Clicking New opens the inline form; saving posts JSON to /api/phones/save and the list updates.

Clicking Edit pre-fills the form; saving updates the entry via /api/phones/save.

Clicking Delete opens the in-site modal; confirming sends DELETE /api/phones/<id> and the list updates.

Footer displays the two names (no trailing periods), Gmail compose link for Bisma, Kamran’s email, and the GitHub repo link.

No external JavaScript files are used; all JS is inline in the HTML.

No animations or moving backgrounds; UI is dark but slightly lighter than pure black and visually balanced.
